* Bonder Contract Documentation

** Overview

The Bonder contract is designed for managing Kadena (KDA) token transactions and regulating everything regarding the
financial aspects of the platform, including reward distribution. Due to the current state of pact formal verification, the contract was split in two parts.
The bonder contract can easily be adjusted to become formally verifiable and contains all the sensible functions, variables,
and capabilities that manage funds. It offers functionalities such as bond creation, reward management, token locking for yield,
tracking participation metrics, and claiming lockups. The bonder-utils contract contains functions that don't work well with formal
verification. We intend to use such functions only for read-type local calls and as of now the bonder-utils contract will only work
when interacting with nodes having the `AllowReadsOnLocal` option activated.

** Operational Mechanics

    *Token Management*: The Bonder contract acts as a custodian of KDA tokens, holding them on behalf of users and bond creators. It autonomously tracks and manages each user's token position and associated rewards.

    *Main Entrypoints*: Core functionalities of this contract are accessible through the =create-bond=, =lock=, and =claim= functions. These entry points facilitate bond creation, token locking for yield accrual, and claiming of accrued rewards, respectively.

** Schemas and Tables

   - =contract-lock-status=: Tracks the lock status of the contract.
   - =lockup-option=: Tracks the lockup options and their corresponding properties.
   - =bond-sale=: Records bond sales created by the contract operator.
   - =lockup=: Tracks KDA bonding positions of the Bonder contract's users.
   - =bond-creator=: Tracks accounts allowed to create a bond.
   - =keys-schema=: Schema for storing table keys and optimizing gas consumption.
   - =privilege=: Schema for defining privileges.

** Key Functionalities

- *Bond Creation*: Agents authorized by the contract operator can create bond sales through the =create-bond= function, offering KDA rewards as incentives.

- *Token Locking for Yield*: Users can lock their KDA tokens in the contract using the =lock= function, enabling them to accrue yield rewards over time. When a user creates a new lockup, the maximum rewards they can earn are calculated and removed from the respective bond's available rewards. Based on the user's participation rate (note that there will be no rewards if no poll is created during the lockup period), they will receive a proportional part of their reserved rewards, with the remainder returning to the available rewards pool. Additionally, when a user creates a new lockup, the =polls-at-lock= field in the =lockup= schema will record the number of existing polls for that bond at the time of lockup. This ensures that the rewards for new lockups are independent of any previous ones.

- *Managing Participation Metrics*: Users participating in governance polls can boost their Annual Percentage Rate (APR). The functions that are fundamental to compute the boost are the =increment-bonder-interactions= and =increment-bond-polls= functions. These are secured so that they can only be called by the poller contract.

- *Claiming Lockups*: After locking their KDA and participating on the proposed polls, users can claim their original amounts with their rightful rewards. It is important to note that users can lock their KDA again in the same bond only after claiming the rewards from previous lockups.

- *Reward Management*: The =claim-back-rewards= and =add-bond-rewards= functions allow the bond creator to manage rewards. If the program if giving good results but is running out of rewards, the creator can add extra rewards, which will open extra spots for more users. On the other hand, the creator can get the available rewards back. The latter will not affect existing positions but may close the program for new users.

** Reward Computation Details

When a bond is created, there are lockup tiers that are determined by the creator. Each tier has the following properties:

=option-length=: Amount of time that the users kda will be locked. E.g (days 3)
=time-multiplier=: APR boost for locking in this tier. E.g 1.1
=poller-max-boost=: Maximum APR boost for poll participation. E.g 1.05
=polling-power-multiplier= : Factors into the polling power computation. E.g 2.0

Additionally, the bond has the =base-apr= (e.g 1.05) global parameter and for each user on that bond we record the participation-rate parameter.  When a user locks an amount =x= of KDA on a tier, the amount they get back after =option-length= time is:

=claim = x * base-apr * time-multiplier * (poller-max-boost * participation-rate + 1 * ( 1 - participation-rate - polls-at-lock))=

Where =polls-at-lock= is the number of polls associated with the bond at lock time.

The total rewards earned by the user can be computed as
=claim - x=

And the earnings rate is given by

=(claim/x) -1=

TL;DR: The user gets maximum APR when they lock in the tier having the biggest =time-multiplier * poller-max-boost= (would normally be the longest one) and participates in all the polls. So in each bond the APR cap would be

=base-apr*MAX_time-multiplier*poller-max-boost=

The polling power (used for voting on polls) is computed as =x*polling-power-multiplier=

*** Examples

Similarly to what we are doing on the =bonder.repl= file, let us take a quick look at three totally distinct types of bonds that are supported by our contract


**** Example 1: Valid Bond Creation - A Bond Weighting Rewards and Participation

In this example, a bond is created with parameters that significantly influence reward computation based on both the bond's duration and the participants' activities.

- *Parameters*:
  - =option-name=: "3 months" and "6 months"
  - =option-length=: 90 days and 180 days
  - =time-multiplier=: 1.25 and 1.5
  - =poller-max-boost=: 1.1 and 1.15
  - =polling-power-multiplier=: 5.0 and 8.0
  - =min-amount=: 100.0
  - =max-amount=: 10000.0
  - =base-apr=: 1.1
  - =total-rewards=: 15000.0
  - =start-time=: January 11, 2024
  - =creator=: "k:bob"
  - =polls-at-lock=: 0

- *Influence on Rewards*:

  Assume that Alice locks 1000 KDA on the 6-month option of this bond and participates in  8 of 10 polls. In this case her returns will be given by

  =1000 * 1.1 * 1.5 * (0.8*1.15 + 0.2) = 1.848=. This means that Alice had an 84.4% ROI during her lockup

This setup encourages participants to engage more frequently in polling activities and also commit their assets for longer periods to maximize their returns.

**** Example 2: Valid Bond Creation - No Participation Rewards

In this example, the bond's reward structure is influenced solely by the time duration, without additional rewards for participation.

- *Parameters*:
  - =option-name=: "12 months" and "24 months"
  - =option-length=: 365 days and 730 days
  - =time-multiplier=: 1.5 and 2.0
  - =poller-max-boost=: 1.0
  - =polling-power-multiplier=: 1.0 and 2.0
  - =min-amount=: 100.0
  - =max-amount=: 1000.0
  - =base-apr=: 1.0
  - =total-rewards=: 10000.0
  - =start-time=: January 13, 2024
  - =creator=: "k:alice"
  - =polls-at-lock=: 0

- *Influence on Rewards*:
 If Bob locks 500 KDA on the 24-month option of this bond, he will receive rewards based solely on the duration of his lockup, only needing to participate one single time to claim full rewards. In this case, Bob's returns are computed as

 =500*2.0=1000=. That results in a 100% ROI for Bob.

This example illustrates a straightforward reward system where the focus is on the commitment duration rather than active engagement.

**** Example 3: Valid Bond Creation - Only Participation Rewards

This example highlights a bond where rewards are more heavily influenced by participation, rather than just the time duration.

- *Parameters*:
  - =option-name=: "12 months" and "24 months"
  - =option-length=: 365 days and 730 days
  - =time-multiplier=: 1.0
  - =poller-max-boost=: 1.5 and 2.0
  - =polling-power-multiplier=: 1.0 and 2.0
  - =min-amount=: 100.0
  - =max-amount=: 1000000.0
  - =base-apr=: 1.0
  - =total-rewards=: 1000.0
  - =start-time=: January 12, 2024
  - =creator=: "k:tom"
  - =polls-at-lock=: 0

- *Influence on Rewards*:
 Assume Tom locks 10000 KDA on the 12-month option of this bond and participates in 80% of the polls. In this case we can obtain Tom's returns by computing

 =10000*(0.8*2 + 0.2)=18000=. Clearly, Tom had an 80% gain.

This structure encourages participants to be highly active in polling to maximize their returns, making participation the key factor in the reward calculation.


This example highlights a bond where rewards are more heavily influenced by participation, rather than just the time duration.

** Security and Validation

The Bonder contract incorporates plenty security measures and validation checks to ensure the integrity and proper functioning of its features. These mechanisms are crucial for preventing unauthorized actions, ensuring data consistency, and maintaining the contract's overall security posture.

*** Capabilities, Guards, and Privileges

- *Guarded Capabilities*: The contract defines specific capabilities (GOVERNANCE, OPS, INTERNAL, LOCK, CLAIM) that restrict access to critical functions. For example, the GOVERNANCE capability ensures that only designated administrators can perform certain administrative tasks such as contract updates, while the OPS capability is reserved for operational actions by authorized operators.

- *Dynamic Capability Acquisition*: Functions like lock and claim require the dynamic acquisition of capabilities (LOCK, CLAIM) to execute, ensuring that actions are only performed by users who meet the necessary criteria at the time of execution.

- *Privileges*: There are some functions from the Poller contract that write values to tables that 'belong' to the bonder contract. To ensure that such functions can only be called by the poller contract, we have a special table that associates guards to actions on the contract. Such guard is created and stored on the table when the poller contract is deployed.

*** Validation Checks

- *Bond and Lockup Validations*: The =validate-bond= and =validate-lockup-option= functions ensure that bonds and lockup options adhere to predefined rules, such as positive reward amounts, valid time frames, and minimum APR requirements.

- *Time Constraints*: There are functions and capabilities that enforce time-related constraints. For example, we use =(enforce-guard (after-date start-time))=, to ensure actions occur within the designated time windows, preventing premature or belated operations that could disrupt bond sales or reward distributions.

- *Reward Availability*: The LOCK capability includes checks to confirm sufficient rewards are available for new lockups, as seen in the enforcement line: =enforce (>= (- total-rewards (+ locked-rewards given-rewards)) rewards)=.

- *Whitelist and Participation Checks*: Certain operations are restricted to whitelisted accounts or those that have participated within specific periods, enhancing the contract's governance and incentive structures.

*** Security Events and Guard Checks

- *Security Events (@event)*: Key actions within the contract are marked with the @event keyword, facilitating the tracking and auditing of significant operations, such as lockups and claims, enhancing transparency and traceability.
- *Enforce Guards*: The contract employs =enforce-guard= statements to validate the identity and permissions of users attempting to execute sensitive functions, ensuring that only authorized individuals can perform those actions.

*** Account and Principal Validations
- *Account Type Checks*: The contract includes checks to ensure that only valid Kadena account types (e.g., k: prefixed accounts) can participate in certain actions, as seen in =validate-principal-account=.
- *Unique Lockup Identifiers*: The construction of lockup keys using the =get-lockup-key= function ensures that each lockup is uniquely identifiable, preventing conflicts and ensuring the integrity of user positions.

These security and validation mechanisms work together to safeguard the contract against unauthorized access, ensure the consistency and accuracy of contract data, and maintain a secure and reliable environment for managing Kadena token transactions and governance activities.


* Poller Contract Documentation
